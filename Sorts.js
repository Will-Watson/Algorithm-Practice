//selection sort

//selection sort, like bubble sort compares two values but first loops through to find the minimum value then switches that value to the front. Incrementing the starting point as we go, finding the smallest value and switching it to the front

//this algo is great for data thats almost sorted already
//super slow otherwise

/*

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^        ^
[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
    ^        ^
[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]

etc...

-store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
-compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number
-if a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
-if the 'minimum' is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values
-repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.

//insertion sort

//insertion sort builds up the first half of the array by inserting the following element into the right place

-start by picking the second element in the array
-now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
-continue to the enxt element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e. the left side) to place the element in the correct place.
-repeat until the array is sorted.

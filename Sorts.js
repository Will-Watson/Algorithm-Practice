-compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number
-if a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
-if the 'minimum' is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values
-repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.

-now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary

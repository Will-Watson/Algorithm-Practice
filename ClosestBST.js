//Write a function that takes in a binary search tree and a target integer value and returns the the closest value to that target value.

//iterate through tree using search parameters
//define helper function to keep track of closest node value
//compare current value to following value and determine which value is closest to target
//traverse tree based on whether or not the current value is less than or greater than target value (left, right)
//edge cases possible null tree or node value === target value, in which case we can just return the target value.

/*
Write a function that takes in a potentially invalid Binary Search Tree (BST) and returns a boolean representing whether the BST is valid.

each BST node has an integer value, a left child noe, and a right child node. A node is said to be valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: it's value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children noes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.

A BST is valid if and only if all of its noes are valid BST nodes.

  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;

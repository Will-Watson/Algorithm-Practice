/*
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of arbitrary intervals, merges any overlapping intervals, and returns the new intervals in no particular order.

Each interval interval is an array of two intergers, with interval[0] as the start of the interval and interval[1] as the end of the interval.

Note that the back-to-back intervals aren't considered to be overlapping. For example, [1, 5] and [6, 7] aren't overlaping' however, [1, 6] and [6, 7] are indeed overlapping.

Also note that the start of any particular interval will always be less than or equal to the end of that interval.

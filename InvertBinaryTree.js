/*

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a rigth child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None/ null.

/*

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

//then I want to iterate through the jewels string checking if they exist in the frequency counter. If they do I want to add them to the result counter
//return the result counter.

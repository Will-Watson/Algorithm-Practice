//stack crash course
//abstract data structure
//collection of data that needs to abide by a LIFO principle which is last in first out

const stack = [];

stack.push('google');
stack.push('instagram');
stack.push('youtube');

stack.pop();

//example of a LIFO stack, push and pop in tandum

const stack2 = [];

stack.unshift('create new file');
stack.unshift('reszied file');
stack.unshift('cloned out wrinkle');

stack.unshift();

//another example.. but obviously push and pop is better for big O notation as its faster
